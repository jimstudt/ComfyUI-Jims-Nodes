# Jim's ComfyUI Nodes

## Grumpy Old Man Notice

Because, MY GOD PEOPLE! Would it kill you to write a line of instuction
on how to use a node? Between trying to sort out obsolete nodes and finding
just the right set of nodes which will perform a function together then
having that mess on my screen... It's just got to be easier to write my own.

## Promises

- I promise nothing. If I have accidentally left this somewhere and you
  found it, maybe just move along. This is just me scratching my own itches.

## Nodes

### Crop Chest Node

Find the biggest face. Assume the person is upright. Make a crop which likely
contains their chest and face. (Shh you perverts, I'm making random necklaces.
And exploring zooming in and enhancing from wider pictures. You will be sad,
it is tuned to try to be above the boobs.)

I expect I will make a more complicated "zoom and enhance" node with
flexible targeting, but I'm learning on this one.
